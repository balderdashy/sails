/**
 * Views
 * 
 * Server-sent views are a classic and effective way to get your app up and running.
 * Views are normally served from controllers, but by default, Sails also exposes routes
 * to allow you to preview your views in a browser.  This automatic routing can be disabled
 * using the `blueprint` config below.  You can also configure your templating language/framework
 * of choice, and configure Sails' layout support.
 *
 * For more information on views and layouts, check out:
 * http://sailsjs.org/#documentation

module.exports.views = {

  // If enabled, views are automatically served at logical routes,
  // based on their paths. This comes in handy any time you just want to
  // serve some static HTML. (i.e. a brochure site)
  // 
  // For example, the static view files below are available at the specified routes:
  //		`views/catalog.ejs`			: `get /catalog`
  //		`views/catalog/index.ejs`	: both `get /catalog` & `get /catalog/index`
  //		`views/catalog/story.ejs`	: `get /catalog/story`
  routes: true,


  // Layouts are simply top-level HTML templates you can use as wrappers 
  // for your server-side views.  If you're using ejs, you can take advantage of
  // Sails' built-in `layout` support.
  // 
  // With using a layout, when one of your views is served, it is injected into
  // the <%- body %> partial defined in the layout.  This lets you reuse header
  // and footer logic between views.
  // 
  // The `layout` setting may be set to one of:
  // 
  // true			::	use default ('layout'), located at `views/layout.ejs`
  //
  // false		::	don't use a layout
  //
  // "string"		::	the relative path to your layout from `views/`
  //					the view engine extension, e.g. ".ejs", may be omitted)
  //
  layout: 'layout',


  // If you'd like to use more than one `layout` file, you can!
  // Before rendering a view, override the `layout` locally by setting `res.locals.layout`
  // (handy if you parts of your app are completely different from each other)
  //
  // e.g. your default might be
  // layout: 'layouts/public'
  // 
  // But you might override that in some of your controllers with:
  // layout: 'layouts/internal'



  // Templating engine/language to be used for your app's **server-side** views
  // 
  // Currently supported:
  // 
  //		ejs
  //		jade
  //
  engine: 'ejs'



  // *-> Using Layouts With Other View Engines
  //
  // In Express 3, built-in support for layouts/partials was deprecated.
  // Instead, developers are expected to rely on the view engines themselves to 
  // implement this features.
  // (see https://github.com/balderdashy/sails/issues/494 for more info on that)
  //
  // Since adopting Express 3, Sails has chosen to support the legacy `layouts` feature
  // for convenience, backwards compatibility with Express 2.x and Sails 0.8.x apps,
  // and in particular, familiarity for new community members coming from other MVC frameworks.
  // 
  // As a result, layouts have only been tested with the default view engine (ejs).
  //
  // If layouts aren't your thing, or (for now) if you're using a server-side view engine 
  // other than ejs, (e.g. Jade, handlebars, haml, dust) you'll need to set this option to:
  // `layout:false` and then rely on your view engine's built-in layout/partial support.
