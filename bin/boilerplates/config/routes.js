 * Routes

/**
 * (1) Static assets
 *
 * Flat files in your `assets` directory- (these are sometimes referred to as 'public')
 * If you have an image file at `/assets/images/foo.jpg`, it will be made available 
 * automatically via the route:  `/images/foo.jpg`
 *
 */




/**
 * (2) Static routes
 *
 * This object routes static URLs to handler functions--
 * In most cases, these functions are actions inside of your controllers.
 * For convenience, you can also connect routes directly to views or external URLs.
 *

module.exports.routes = {

  // By default, your root route (aka home page) points to a view
  // located at `views/home/index.ejs`
  // 
  // (This would also work if you had a file at: `/views/home.ejs`)
  '/': {
    view: 'home/index'
  }

  /*
  // But what if you want your home page to display
  // a signup form located at `views/user/signup.ejs`?
  '/': {
    view: 'user/signup'
  }


  // Let's say you're building an email client, like Gmail
  // You might want your home route to serve an interface using custom logic.
  // In this scenario, you have a custom controller `MessageController`
  // with an `inbox` action.
  '/': 'MessageController.inbox'


  // Alternatively, you can use the more verbose syntax:
  '/': {
    controller: 'MessageController',
    action: 'inbox'
  }


  // If you decided to call your action `index` instead of `inbox`,
  // since the `index` action is the default, you can shortcut even further to:
  '/': 'MessageController'


  // Up until now, we haven't specified a specific HTTP method/verb
  // The routes above will apply to ALL verbs!
  // If you want to set up a route only for one in particular
  // (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.), just specify the verb before the path.
  // For example, if you have a `UserController` with a `signup` action,
  // and somewhere else, you're serving a signup form looks like: 
  //
  //		<form action="/signup">
  //			<input name="username" type="text"/>
  //			<input name="password" type="password"/>
  //			<input type="submit"/>
  //		</form>


  // You could define the following route:
  'post /signup': 'UserController.signup'


  // Finally, here's an example of how you would route all GET requests 
  // to the `/google` route to Google's website:
  'get /google': 'http://google.com'

 *   + If you have a controller, `FooController`:
 *     + its action `bar` is accessible at `/foo/bar`
 *     + its action `index` is accessible at `/foo/index`, and also `/foo`
