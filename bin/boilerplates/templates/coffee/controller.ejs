 # @module      :: Controller
 # @description	:: A set of functions called `actions`.
 #
 #                 Actions contain code telling Sails how to respond to a certain type of request.
 #                 (i.e. do stuff, then send some JSON, show an HTML page, or redirect to another URL)
 #
 #                 You can configure the blueprint URLs which trigger these actions (`config/controllers.js`)
 #                 and/or override them with custom routes (`config/routes.js`)
 #
 #                 NOTE: The code you write here supports both HTTP and Socket.io automatically.
 #

   # Actions

   # Code that should be run when Sails receives an HTTP request 
   # or a properly structured message from Socket.io.

   # e.g.
   # sayHello: (req, res) ->
   #   res.send 'Hello world!'
