 * Boilerplate controller

 * This is the template used when generating controllers via the CLI
 * e.g. `sails generate controller foo`
 * 
 * Note to new contributors:
 * Controllers in Sails are special--
 * As you might expect, the code you write here responds to traditional HTTP requests,
 * but it also works out of the box with messages from Socket.io.

 * @module      :: Controller
 * @description	:: A set of functions called `actions`.
 *
 *                 Actions contain code telling Sails how to respond to a certain type of request.
 *                 (i.e. do stuff, then send some JSON, show an HTML page, or redirect to another URL)
 *
 *                 You can configure the blueprint URLs which trigger these actions (`config/controllers.js`)
 *                 and/or override them with custom routes (`config/routes.js`)
 *
 *                 NOTE: The code you write here supports both HTTP and Socket.io automatically.
