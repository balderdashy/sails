Sails.js is a web framework that makes it easy to build custom, enterprise-grade Node.js apps. It is designed to resemble the MVC architecture from frameworks like Ruby on Rails, but with support for the more modern, data-oriented style of web app development. It's especially good for building realtime features like chat.


## Installation &nbsp;  [![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/sails.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/sails)

**With [node](http://nodejs.org) [installed](http://sailsjs.org/#!documentation/new-to-nodejs):**
```sh
# Get the latest stable release of Sails
$ sudo npm install sails -g
```

> ######New release available
> The v0.11 release of Sails (with support for Socket.io v1.0) is here!  To read the v0.11 migration guide, click [here](http://sailsjs.org/#!/documentation/concepts/Upgrading).


## Your First Sails Project

**Create a new app:**
```sh
# Create the app
$ sails new testProject
```

**Lift sails:**
```sh
# cd into the new folder
$ cd testProject

## Compatibility

Sails is built on [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/), [Connect](http://www.senchalabs.org/connect/), [Express](http://expressjs.com/), and [Socket.io](http://socket.io/).

Sails [controllers](http://sailsjs.org/#!documentation/controllers) are compatible with Connect middleware, so in most cases, you can paste code into Sails from an existing Express project and everything will work-- plus you'll be able to use WebSockets to talk to your API, and vice versa.

[Balderdash](http://balderdash.co) designs/builds scalable Node.js apps for startups and enterprise customers.  After building a few apps and taking them into production, we realized that the Node.js development landscape was very much still the Wild West.  Over time, after trying lots of different methodologies, we decided to crystallize all of our best practices into this framework.  [I](http://twitter.com/mikermcneil) hope it saves you some time :)
