Sails.js is a web framework that makes it easy to build custom, enterprise-grade Node.js apps. It is designed to resemble the MVC architecture from frameworks like Ruby on Rails, but with support for the more modern, data-oriented style of web app development. It's especially good for building realtime features like chat.


## Installation &nbsp;
**With [node](http://nodejs.org) [installed](http://sailsjs.org/#!documentation/new-to-nodejs):**
```sh
# Get the latest stable release of Sails
$ sudo npm install sails -g
```

> ######Upgrading from 0.9 or 0.10?
> The v0.11 release of Sails includes support for Socket.io v1, and contains a few breaking changes which affect userland. To read the v0.11 migration guide, click [here](http://sailsjs.org/version-notes/0point10-to-0point11-migration-guide).


## Your First Sails Project

**Create a new app:**
```sh
# Create the app
$ sails new testProject
```

**Lift sails:**
```sh
# cd into the new folder
$ cd testProject

# fire up the server
$ sails lift
```

**Generate a REST API:**

## Compatibility

Sails is built on [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/), [Connect](http://www.senchalabs.org/connect/), [Express](http://expressjs.com/), and [Socket.io](http://socket.io/).

Sails [controllers](http://sailsjs.org/documentation/concepts/controllers) are compatible with Connect middleware, so in most cases, you can paste code into Sails from an existing Express project and everything will work-- plus you'll be able to use WebSockets to talk to your API, and vice versa.

The ORM, [Waterline](https://github.com/balderdashy/waterline), has a well-defined adapter system for supporting all kinds of datastores.  Officially supported databases include [MySQL](https://github.com/balderdashy/sails-mysql), [PostgreSQL](https://github.com/balderdashy/sails-postgresql), [MongoDB](https://github.com/balderdashy/sails-mongo), [SQLite3](https://github.com/AndrewJo/sails-sqlite3), [Redis](https://github.com/balderdashy/sails-redis), local [disk](https://github.com/balderdashy/sails-disk), and local [memory](https://github.com/balderdashy/sails-memory).  [Community adapters](https://github.com/balderdashy/sails-docs/blob/master/contributing/intro-to-custom-adapters.md#notable-community-adapters) exist for [CouchDB](https://github.com/search?q=sails+couch&nwo=codeswarm%2Fsails-couchdb-orm&search_target=global&ref=cmdform), [neDB](https://github.com/adityamukho/sails-nedb), [TingoDB](https://github.com/andyhu/sails-tingo), [SQLite](https://github.com/AndrewJo/sails-sqlite3/tree/0.10), [Oracle](https://github.com/search?q=sails+oracle&type=Repositories&ref=searchresults), [MSSQL](https://github.com/cnect/sails-mssql), [DB2](https://github.com/search?q=sails+db2&type=Repositories&ref=searchresults), [ElasticSearch](https://github.com/search?q=%28elasticsearch+AND+sails%29+OR+%28elasticsearch+AND+waterline%29+&type=Repositories&ref=searchresults), [Riak](https://github.com/search?q=sails+riak&type=Repositories&ref=searchresults),

Back in 2012, we were designing/builing scalable Node.js apps for startups and enterprise customers.  After building a few applications and taking them into production, we realized that the Node.js development landscape was very much still the Wild West.  Over time, after trying lots of different methodologies, we decided to crystallize all of our best practices into this framework.  Four years later, Sails is now one of the most widely-used web application frameworks in the world. We hope it saves you some time! :)
