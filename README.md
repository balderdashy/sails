Sails
====

Sails is designed to resemble Ruby on Rails with its MVC (Model View Controller) architecture and convention-over-configuration philosophy. Like Node.JS, Sails.JS written in JavaScript, the language most developers are already using. Sails provides a familiar framework for custom apps which cuts development to a fraction of the time.

Sails does a few things other MVC frameworks can't do:
- Sails provides all the productivity benefits of Ruby on Rails, but with the realtime capabilities and asynchronous efficiency of Node.js; all in the same language we're already using, JavaScript.
- Sails routes Socket.io messages the same way as HTTP requests through Express.  When dealing with a Socket.io-initiated request, Sails transparently overrides Express' request and response objects to allow your code to be transport-agnostic.semantics (`res.send`).  This enables a consistent development interface and keeps you from having to reinvent the wheel just to share logic between Express and Socket.io.
- Sails also contains built-in authentication and role-based access control.  As it should, this works the same way for Socket.io messages as it does for Express requests. (See https://github.com/balderdashy/sails-example)


Installation
--
```npm install sails```

Or to install with the command line tool:
```sudo npm install -g sails```

Getting Started
--
If you installed Sails with the command line tool above, the following command will generate a new Sails project, ```nameOfNewApp/```, in the current directory:

```sails nameOfNewApp```

Example

Dependencies and Compatibility
--

Tested with node 0.6.4 up to node 0.8.1

We built Sails on the rock-solid foundations of ExpressJS, Sequelize ORM, and Socket.io.  


## Who Built This?
The Sails framework is jointly developed and supported by Mike McNeil and Balderdash Design Co.  Balderdash builds realtime web apps as a service, and after much frustration with the lack of convention in existing solutions, we built Sails to use on our customers' projects.  Naturally, we open-sourced it.  Hopefully, it makes your life a little bit easier!
