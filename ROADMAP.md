> Also take a second to check that your feature request is relevant to Sails core and not one of its dependencies (e.g. Waterline, one of its adapters, one of the core generators, etc.)  If you aren't sure, feel free to send the PR here and someone will make sure it finds its way to the right place.  Note that (for now) core hooks reside in Sails core and so relevant feature requests for a specific hook _do_ belong in this file.

## Roadmap

Our short-to-medium-term roadmap items, in order of descending priority:


 Feature                                                  | Owner                                                                            | Details
 :------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------
 Improve performance and stability of `update` queries in SQL adapters |  _your name here_   | See [this issue](https://github.com/balderdashy/sails-mysql/issues/253) for details |
 Log key configuration info on lift                       | [@mikermcneil](https://github.com/mikermcneil)     | For example, if `config/local.js` is present, log a message explaining that it will be used.  See also https://github.com/dominictarr/rc/issues/23#issuecomment-33875197
 Lock + unlock app in dev env                             | [@mikermcneil](https://github.com/mikermcneil)     | Capability for a hook to "lock" and/or "unlock" the app (in a development env only).  When "locked" all requests are intercepted by an endpoint which responds with either a page or JSON payload communicating a custom message.  e.g. so the grunt hook can let us know as it syncs.  e.g. `sails.emit('lock')`
 Hook dependency/load order mgmt                          | [@mikermcneil](https://github.com/mikermcneil)                                   | rebase the hook dependency+optional depenency system originally proposed by @ragulka
 Standalone router                                        | [@mikermcneil](https://github.com/mikermcneil)                                   | replace express dependency in `lib/router` with standalone router- either routification or @dougwilson's new project.  See https://github.com/balderdashy/sails/pull/2351#issuecomment-71855236 for more information.
 Standalone view renderer                                 | [@mikermcneil](https://github.com/mikermcneil)                                   | Use @fishrock123's standalone views module (enables views over sockets).  See https://github.com/balderdashy/sails/pull/2351#issuecomment-71855236 for more information.
 Standalone static middleware                             | [@mikermcneil](https://github.com/mikermcneil)                                   | use static middleware directly in `lib/router` (enables static files over sockets)  See https://github.com/balderdashy/sails/pull/2351#issuecomment-71855236 for more information.
 Break out core hooks into separate modules               | [@mikermcneil](https://github.com/mikermcneil)                                   | Makes Sails more composable, and removes most of its dependencies in core. Also allows for easier sharing of responsibility w/ the community, controls issue flow.  Started with github.com/balderdashy/sails-hook-sockets
 Allow session handling to be turned off for static assets | [@sgress454](https://github.com/sgress454) | In certain situations, a request for a static asset concurrent to a request to a controller action can have undesirable consequences; specifically, a race condition can occur wherein the static asset response ends up overwriting changes that were made to the session in the controller action.  Luckily, this is a very rare issue, and only occurs when there are race conditions from two different simultaneous requests sent from the same browser with the same cookies.  If you encounter this issue today, first think about whether you actually need/want to do things this way.  If you absolutely need this functionality, a workaround is to change the order of middleware or override the `session` middleware implementation in `config/http.js`.  However, for the long-term, we need a better solution.  It would be good to improve the default behavior of our dependency, `express-session` so that it uses a smarter heuristics.  For more information, see the implementation of session persistence in [express-session](https://github.com/expressjs/session/blob/master/index.js#L207).  However, the single cleanest solution to the general case of this issue would be the ability to turn off session handling features for all static assets (or on a per-route basis).  This is easier said than done.  If you'd like to have this feature, and have the cycles/chops to implement it, please tweet @sgress454 or @mikermcneil and we can dive in and work out a plan.  Summary of what we could merge:  We could remove the default session middleware from our http middlewareÂ configuration, and instead add it as a manual step in the virtual router that runs before the route action is triggered.  Good news it that we're actually already doing this in order to support sessions [in the virtual router](https://github.com/balderdashy/sails/blob/master/lib/router/index.js#L101) (e.g. for use w/ socket.io).  So the actual implementation isn't a lot of work-- just needs some new automated tests written, as well as a lot of manual testing (including w/ redis sessions).  We also need to update our HTTP docs to explain that requests for static assets no longer create a session by default, and that default HTTP session support is no longer configured via Express's middleware chain (handled by the virtual router instead.)  Finally we'd also need to document how to enable sessions for assets (i.e. attaching the express-session middleware in `config/http.js`, but doing so directly _before_ the static middleware runs so that other routes don't try to retrieve/save the session twice)



#### Backlog

The backlog consists of features which are not currently in the immediate-term roadmap above, but are useful.  We would exuberantly accept a pull request implementing any of the items below, so long as it was accompanied with reasonable tests that prove it, and it doesn't break other core functionality.

_(feel free to suggest things)_

 Feature                                         | Owner                                              | Details
 :---------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------- | :------
 SPDY/HTTP2 protocol support                     | [@mikermcneil](https://github.com/mikermcneil)     | https://github.com/balderdashy/sails/issues/80
 Have a `sails migrate` or `sails create-db` command | [@globegitter](https://github.com/Globegitter) | For production environments it would be nice to have a save/secure command that creates the db automatically for you
 `sails generate test`  | [@jedd-ahyoung](https://github.com/jedd-ahyoung) | Generate *.test.js following [Sails recommended directory structure](http://sailsjs.org/#!/documentation/concepts/Testing). Example usage: `sails generate test User:Model` creates prepopulated file '/test/unit/models/UserModel.test.js'. See https://github.com/balderdashy/sails/pull/2499 for discussion |
 Wildcard action policies | [@ProLoser](https://github.com/ProLoser)| Instead of only having one global action policy `'*'` it would be nice if we could define policies for a specific action in all controllers: `'*/destroy': ['isOwner']` or something similar.
Have option to just populate relationship ids instead of whole values | [@BrighTide](https://github.com/BrighTide)| A lot of the time I find it far more effecient/effective to just talk about database entities as an id, rather than get the whole object. Not a huge problem for backend, but can make a massive speed difference for frontend stuff.
