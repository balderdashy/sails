## Roadmap

Our short-to-medium-term roadmap items, in order of descending priority:

_(feel free to suggest things)_


 Feature                                                  | Owner                                                                            | Details
 :------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------
 Socket.io 1.0                                            | [@mikermcneil](https://github.com/mikermcneil)                                   | upgrade to Socket.io 1.0
 Hook dependency/load order mgmt                          | [@mikermcneil](https://github.com/mikermcneil)                                   | rebase the hook dependency+optional depenency system originally proposed by @ragulka
 Standalone router                                        | [@mikermcneil](https://github.com/mikermcneil)                                   | replace express dependency in `lib/router` with standalone router- either routification or @dougwilson's new project
 Standalone view renderer                                 | [@mikermcneil](https://github.com/mikermcneil)                                   | Use @fishrock123's standalone views module (enables views over sockets)
 Standalone static middleware                             | [@mikermcneil](https://github.com/mikermcneil)                                   | use static middleware directly in `lib/router` (enables static files over sockets)
 Request interpreter: Full stream support                 | [@mikermcneil](https://github.com/mikermcneil)                                   | Use new manufactured req/res streams in lib/hooks/sockets (this adds full streams2 compatibility to our socket.io integration, or more generally for any type of attached server)
 Break out core hooks into separate modules               | [@mikermcneil](https://github.com/mikermcneil)                                   | Makes Sails more composable, and removes most of its dependencies in core. Also allows for easier sharing of responsibility w/ the community, controls issue flow


#### Backlog

The backlog consists of features which are not currently in the immediate-term roadmap above, but are useful.  We would exuberantly accept a pull request implementing any of the items below, so long as it was accompanied with reasonable tests that prove it, and it doesn't break other core functionality.
