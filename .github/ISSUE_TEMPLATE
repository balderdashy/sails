Before you submit an issue for Sails, please make sure you have read the issue contribution guide (http://bit.ly/sails-issue-guide) carefully, and then verify the following by typing an X in between each set of [ ] brackets below (don't make any other changes to the text!):

### BEGIN PLEDGE ###
- [ ] I am experiencing a concrete technical issue (aka a bug) with Sails (ideas and feature proposals should follow the guide for proposing features and enhancements (http://bit.ly/sails-feature-guide), which involves making a pull request).  If you're not 100% certain whether it's a bug or not, that's okay--you may continue.  The worst that can happen is that the issue will be closed and we'll point you in the right direction.

- [ ] I am not asking a question about how to use Sails or about whether or not Sails has a certain feature (please refer to the documentation(http://sailsjs.org), or post on http://stackoverflow.com, our Google Group (http://bit.ly/sails-google-group) or our live chat (https://gitter.im/balderdashy/sails).

- [ ] I have already searched for related issues, and found none open (if you found a related _closed_ issue, please link to it in your post).

- [ ] My issue title is concise, on-topic and polite ("jst.js being removed from layout.ejs on lift" is good; "templates dont work" or "why is sails dumb" are not so good).

- [ ] I have tried all the following (if relevant) and my issue remains:
  - Make sure you have the right app lifted.
  - Make sure you've killed the Sails server with CTRL+C and started it again.
  - Make sure you closed any open browser tabs pointed at localhost before starting Sails.
  - Make sure you do not have any other Sails apps running in other terminal windows.
  - Make sure the app you are using to reproduce the issue has a clean node_modules/ directory, meaning:
    * no dependencies are linked (e.g. you haven't run npm link foo)
    * that you haven't made any inline changes to files in the node_modules/ folder
    * that you don't have any weird global dependency loops. The easiest way to double-check any of the above, if you aren't sure, is to run: rm -rf node_modules && npm cache clear && npm install.

and finally...
- [ ] **I can provide steps to reproduce this issue that others can follow.**

Ideally, this involves creating a new repo that demonstrates the problem (see instructions at http://bit.ly/sails-issue-repro).  Even though your issue may seem so simple to reproduce that a new repo is unnecessary, you'd be surprised how many solutions present themselves when you start from `sails new` and attempt to recreate your issue from scratch in a new app.  This ensures that the real issue isn't in your user code (a forgotten policy file, perhaps?) or in a third-party module.  If you're absolutely _convinced_ that a new repo is unnecessary, provide clear, concise and _specific_ steps to reproduce the problem in your post (not "create a model then do blueprint create").
