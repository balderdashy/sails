#### Framework:
- **New model methods: `.updateOne()`, `.destroyOne()`, and `.archiveOne()`**
- **`exits` argument may now be excluded from your `fn` function in all helpers, actions2 definitions, and shell scripts.**
- **Cleaner usage for `.stream()`,  `.transaction()`, and `.leaseConnection()`.  Functions provided as procedural parameters (i.e. `during` and iteratees) no longer expect a callback to be invoked, as long as you omit their 2nd callabck argument from the function signature.**
- **The bootstrap function (`config/bootstrap.js`) and the `initialize` function of hooks no longer expect a callback to be invoked, as long as the callback argument is excluded from the function signature.**
- **New chainable methods available on helper invocations: `.timeout()` and `.retry()`.**
- Use vuejs VueRouter (and a virtual page example) by default, and make vuejs <router-view> more apparent
- Update helper, action, and hook generators, plus a few other updates to boilerplate output from generators.
- Update boilerplate bootstrap and hook initialize functions.
- Disable 'async' dependency when generated the expanded starter app, to avoid confusion.  (Can always still be installed, it just won't be bundled by default anymore, and auto-globalization is also, of course, disabled.)
- Include FontAwesome 4 files, and update instructions for removal if desired
- Update check for production/staging in vuejs to assume we're in production if no SAILS_LOCALS are present
- Provide documentation tip on how to configure Mongo as default datastore w/ link to tutorial
- Take advantage of next-gen whelk.
- Improve Windows compatibility (for 'sails generate page', sails generate action, etc)
- Exclude 'async' dep by default in all new apps
- Update boilerplate to take advantage of optional 'exits' argument in helpers, actions, and shell scripts.
- Use updated bootstrap for web app template
- Implement Google fonts/typekit/google tag manager/google analytics
- Include (hard-code) Bowser inline now
- Improve <ajax-form> to also include 'is' rule
- Redirect away ALL unrecognized base subdomains (not just webhooks and click), but only do it in staging/production.
- Fix "sails g page" with nested folders on Windows
- Add FileList and FormData to reserved list to protect them from mangling.  (Should be fine anyway, but this protects against potential issues from changing uglify versions.)
- Take advantage of patch in Parasails 0.7.7
- Leverage .updateOne()
- Add 5 second timeout for all four of those calls, to protect user experience from any 3rd party API call issues.  (For context, this is rare, but it happens.  I've noticed Stripe go all 500 on a customer app twice in the last 6 months: once for about 28 minutes earlier this summer, and once last month for a split second.  I've never seen it hang, but this is such a common thing with other 3rd party apis better to be safe than sorry.  An error message after a reasonable wait time is a far better user experience than having to wait 2 whole minutes for the TCP timeout.  And this way, any error handling logic to unroll stuff etc that gets added here will still be able to run.)
- Integrate Cloud SDK into Parasails
- Use top-level implementationSniffingTactic and pass through to whelk and MaA
- Force homogeneous sniffing tactic for helpers+actions.
- Force minimum SVRs (re implementationType: 'classical').
- Finish up support for smarter .bootstrap and .initialize. (Continued from 21bc1f1ab88dfa1064f2e312a4b1135b92763d2a)
- Add faux callbacks for easier debugging
- Add `create` method to datastore fixture, and test "no validation errors" case. [(Scott Gress)](https://github.com/sgress454)
- Fix test descriptions for `update` [(Scott Gress)](https://github.com/sgress454)
- Add test cases for validations on primary key [(Scott Gress)](https://github.com/sgress454)
- Hoist flag for determining whether to apply validation rules, and use it for both PKs and generic attributes. [(Scott Gress)](https://github.com/sgress454)
- Add implementation-sniffing to .stream()
- Setup updateOne() method
- Set up destroyOne() and archiveOne(), and use an omen in the 'found too many' error in findOne() to improve the stack trace.
- Implement implementation sniffing in .transaction() and .leaseConnection().
- Enable ORM to accept attributes named 'length'. Replace `_.each()` with `_.forIn()` to enable ORM to accept attributes named 'length'. [(Daniel Harvey)](https://github.com/danielsharvey)
- Add an isError check when handling errors thrown from validation rules to prevent potential issues in extreme edge cases (where something weird gets thrown)
- Clean up tests for greater clarity and usefulness
- Finish restructuring things to match latest conventions in parley, etc.  Leave standalone/ alias for backwards-compatibility
- Update docs about other adapter methods
- Improve error messaging to assist in debugging
- Add E_TOO_MANY_FILES error code.
- Add Cloud.on() and Cloud.off(), improve error msgs, and remove idempotency guarantee

- Add experimental support for FileList instances (multi-file upload via Cloud SDK).
- Improve performance of +500K ops/sec by collapsing IIFE
- Setup for being able to use AsyncFunctions with .intercept() and .tolerate().
- Add new method: getInvocationinfo() -- a public API for accessing private info such as _timeout. Add .interruptions to getInvocationInfo().
- Introduce working impl of .retry()
- Clone (shallow) metadata on the way in during .retry(), just to avoid any potential edge cases with a fn attaching additional properties and that actually mattering for subsequent invocations with the same arguments.
- Take advantage of new getInvocationInfo() method in parley related to .retry()
- Implement partial support for blended tolerate/intercept with retry (Note: works only for completely parallel error conditions).
- Optimize AsyncFunction function constructor check.
- Allow implementationSniffingTactic to be customized.

See the [Actions and controllers](http://sailsjs.com/documentation/concepts/actions-and-controllers) and [Action target syntax](http://sailsjs.com/documentation/concepts/routes/custom-routes#?action-target-syntax) docs for more info.
* [ENHANCEMENT] Introduce Helpers -- the successor to services.  See the [Helpers](http://sailsjs.com/documentation/concepts/helpers) docs for more info.
* [BUGFIX] Improve path resolution in moduleloader for Windows [f13bb77](https://github.com/balderdashy/sails/commit/f13bb77eb49b9b61aa225c43cc2aacaadd4f07be)
