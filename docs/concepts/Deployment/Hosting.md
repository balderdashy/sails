# Hosting

Here is a non-comprehensive list of Node/Sails hosting providers and a few available community tutorials.  Keep in mind that, most of the time, the process for deploying your Sails app is exactly the same as it would be for any other Node.js app.  Just be sure to take a look at the [other pages](https://sailsjs.com/documentation/concepts/deployment) in this section of the docs (as well as your app's [`config/env/production.js` file](https://sailsjs.com/documentation/anatomy/config/env/production-js)) and make any necessary adjustments before you actually deploy to production.


### Heroku

<a title="Deploy your Sails/Node.js app on Heroku" href="http://heroku.com"><img style="width:285px;" src="https://sailsjs.com/images/deployment_heroku.png" alt="Heroku logo"/></a>

Heroku offers easy, free deployment for any Sails project generated using the Web App template:

1. Create a GitHub repo and push your code up to the `master` branch.
2. Create a Heroku pipeline and a staging app within that pipeline (e.g. `my-cool-site-staging`).
3. Using the point-and-click interface, set up that staging app to auto-deploy from the `deploy` branch of your GitHub repo.
4. Under "Add-ons", set up Papertrail for logging, Redis2Go as your production session store (and for delivering socket messages, if relevant), Heroku Scheduler for scheduled jobs (if relevant), and a database host of your choosing (e.g. MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB).
5. Run through `config/production.js` and `config/staging.js` in your project and set it up.  Any information you feel is too sensitive to hard-code into those files (like database credentials) can be stored in Heroku's config vars (see bundled config files for examples).
6. In the terminal, make sure you've got everything pulled/pushed and are fully in sync with the remote master branch on GitHub.
7. Deploy by typing `sails run deploy`.

You can see a demonstration of this in action [here](https://courses.platzi.com/courses/sails-js/).
