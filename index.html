<h1>Sails.js</h1>

<p>Sails.js makes it easy to build custom, enterprise-grade Node.js apps. It is designed to resemble the MVC architecture from frameworks like Ruby on Rails, but with support for the more modern, data-oriented style of web app development.  It's especially good for building realtime features like chat.</p>

<h1>Intro to Sails.js</h1>
<p style="align: center;text-align: center;">
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/GK-tFvpIR7c" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</p>

<h1 id="npm-install">Installation</h1>

<p>To install the latest stable release with the command-line tool:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre>sudo npm -g install sails
</pre></div>

<h1>Creating a New Sails.js Project</h1>

<p>Create a new app</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="c"># Create the app</span>
sails new testProject
</pre></div>

<p>Lift Sails</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="c"># cd into the new folder</span>
<span class="nb">cd </span>testProject

<span class="c"># Fire up the server  </span>
sails lift
</pre></div>

<p>The default port for Sails is 1337.  At this point if you visit <a href="http://localhost:1337/">http://localhost:1337/</a> You will see the default index.html page.  </p>



<h1>Creating a Model</h1>

<p>Creating a model is very easy with the command line tool. You can even define attributes and their
type by adding arguments at the end of the command. To generate a User model, enter the following:</p>

<pre><code>sails generate model User
</code></pre>

<p>If you check out your app, you'll notice that this created a file at <strong>/api/model/User.js</strong>.</p>



<h1>What's Better Than Scaffolding?  How About a free JSON API?</h1>

<p>Sails.js API scaffolding is nothing like Rails scaffolding. HTML scaffolds just don't make sense for modern web apps (no one uses them.) Instead, Sails automatically builds a RESTful JSON API for your models. And here's the thing, it supports HTTP <em>and</em> WebSockets. By default, for every controller you create, you get the basic CRUD operations created automatically.</p>

<p>For instance, after generating the User model above, if you visit <code>http://localhost:1337/user/create</code>, you'll see:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="nt">"createdAt"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">"2013-01-10T01:33:19.105Z"</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="nt">"updatedAt"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">"2013-01-10T01:33:19.105Z"</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="nt">"id"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>

<p>That's it!  You just created a model in the database!  You can also <code>find</code>, <code>update</code>, and <code>destroy</code> users:</p>

<pre><code># List of all users
http://localhost:1337/user

# Find the user with id 1
http://localhost:1337/user/1

# Create a new user
http://localhost:1337/user/create?name=Fisslewick
(or send an HTTP POST to http://localhost:1337/user)

# Update the name of the user with id 1
http://localhost:1337/user/update/1?name=Gordo
(or send an HTTP PUT to http://localhost:1337/user/1)

# Destroy the user with id 1
http://localhost:1337/user/destroy/1
(or send an HTTP DELETE to http://localhost:1337/user/1)
</code></pre>

<h2>Additional Features</h2>

<p>Sails.js does a few things other Node.js MVC frameworks can't do:</p>

<ul>
<li>Automatically generated JSON API for manipulating models means you don't have to write any backend code to build simple database apps</li>
<li>Built-in authentication, role-based access control, and customizable policies assignable at the controller/action level</li>
<li>Transport agnostic routing: Sails controllers also handle Socket.io / WebSocket messages.  This makes it much easier to send the server-originated or 'comet' notifications you need for features like chat, realtime analytics, and multiplayer games.</li>
<li>Automatic asset minification with Rigging: Your UI code is automatically included in development mode, and minified into a simple, gzipped file in production.

<ul>
<li>Support for:</li>
<li>CoffeeScript</li>
<li>LESS</li>
</ul>
</li>

<h2>Dependencies and Compatibility</h2>

<p>Tested with node 0.8.1
Sails is built on the rock-solid foundations of ExpressJS and Socket.io.  </p>

<h2>Who Built This?</h2>

<p>The Sails framework was developed by Mike McNeil (<a href="https://github.com/mikermcneil" class="user-mention">@mikermcneil</a>) and is supported by Balderdash (<a href="https://github.com/balderdashy" class="user-mention">@balderdashy</a>), a realtime web &amp; mobile studio I started with Heather White (<a href="https://github.com/hdesignsit" class="user-mention">@hdesignsit</a>) in Austin, TX.</p>

<p>After building a few realtime javascript apps and taking them into production, we realized that the  JavaScript development landscape is very much still the Wild West.  Over time, after trying lots of different methodologies (on the front end and the back), we decided to crystallize all of our best practices into this framework.  I hope it saves you some time :)</p>

<h2>License</h2>

<p>Sails is built around so many great open-source technologies that it would never have crossed our minds to keep it proprietary.  We owe huge gratitude and props to TJ Holowaychuk (<a href="https://github.com/visionmedia" class="user-mention">@visionmedia</a>) and Guillermo Rauch (<a href="https://github.com/guille" class="user-mention">@guille</a>) for the work they did, as well as the stewards of all the other open-source modules we use.  Sails could never have been developed without your tremendous contributions to the node community.</p>
