/**
 * testSpawningSailsLiftChildProcessInCwd()
 *
 * This concisely-named test helper function injects a describe block, testing how Sails fares
 * when it comes time to `sails lift` in the current working directory.
 *
 * @required  {String} pathToSailsCLI
 *         the absolute path to the Sails CLI
 *
 * @required {Array} liftCliArgs
 *           an array of additional string CLI args/opts to pass to `sails lift`
 *           (e.g. `['--prod', '--port=\'your butt\'']`)
 *
 * @optional {Dictionary} httpRequestInstructions
 *           A dictionary that gets passed in to `request()` when this helper attempts
 *           to contact the Sails server running in the child process.
 *           If provided at all, this can/must contain:
 *             @required {String} method
 *             @required {String} uri
 *             @optional {String} expectedStatusCode  [defaults to 200]
 *
 * @optional {Function} fnWithAdditionalTests
 *           A function with additional custom tests; that is, it has one or more `it()` blocks inside.
 *
 * @optional {Boolean} expectFailedLift
 *           A flag which, if enabled, causes this test helper to _expect_ the lift to fail.
 *           Also if it is set AND `httpRequestInstructions` are set, then the HTTP request
 *           will still be sent-- but just to _make sure_ it fails too.
