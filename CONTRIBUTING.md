# How to contribute
The community is what makes Sails great, without you we wouldn't have come so far. But to help us keep our sanity and reach code-nirvana together, please follow these quick rules whenever contributing.


## Opening issues
1. If you have a question about setting up Sails, please check out the [Sails docs](http://sailsjs.org/#!documentation).
2. Search for issues similar to yours in [GitHub search](https://github.com/balderdashy/sails/search?) and [Google](https://www.google.nl/search?q=sails+js).
3. If there's an open issue, please contribute to that issue.
4. If there's a closed issue, open a new issue and link the url of the already closed issue(s).
6. If there is no issue, open a new issue and specify the following:
  - A short description of your issue in the title
  - The sails version (find this with ````sails -v````).
  - Exactly when the issue manifests.
  - How long you've experienced this issue.

___Do not try to reopen closed issues, open a new one instead.___


## Submitting Pull Requests
0. If you don't know how to fork and PR, [follow our instructions on contributing](https://github.com/balderdashy/sails/wiki/Contributing-to-Sails).
1. Fork the repo.
2. Add a test for your change. Only refactoring and documentation changes require no new tests. If you are adding functionality or fixing a bug, we need a test!
4. Make the tests pass and make sure you follow [our syntax guidelines](https://github.com/balderdashy/sails/blob/master/.jshintrc).
5. Push to your fork and submit a pull request to our [dev branch](https://github.com/balderdashy/sails/tree/development).

From this point on it's up to us to accept the PR or else suggest improvements or alternatives. We'll typically get back to you within three business days.
